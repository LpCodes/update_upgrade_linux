# Update & Upgrade Linux Script

This Python script is designed to simplify the process of updating and upgrading Linux machines. It works on Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu) that use the `apt` package manager.

## Requirements
- Python 3 must be installed on your Linux machine.
- The script requires `sudo` privileges to run, so make sure you have administrative access.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LpCodes/update_upgrade_linux.git
   cd update-upgrade-linux 

Note : You may need to install Python if you donâ€™t already have it. Run the following command:

  ```sudo apt install python3 ```

## Usage

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using Python3:

```python3 update_upgrade_linux.py ```

You will be prompted to enter your password for sudo access.

The script will automatically:

1. Update the package list.
2. Upgrade installed packages.
3. Remove unnecessary packages.
